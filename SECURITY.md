# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

At NextCraftTalk, we take security seriously. This document outlines our security policy, how to report vulnerabilities, and our commitment to maintaining a secure codebase.

## üö® Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in NextCraftTalk, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please report security vulnerabilities by creating a new GitHub issue:**

1. Go to [Issues](https://github.com/Wicz-Cloud/NextCraftTalk/issues)
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Use the title format: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`
4. Include all relevant details in the issue body
5. Apply the `security` label if available

**‚ö†Ô∏è For active exploitation or emergency situations only:**
- **Email**: security@wicz.cloud
- **Subject**: `[URGENT SECURITY] Active Exploitation - NextCraftTalk`
- Use this channel only if there's immediate risk or active exploitation

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations (optional)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a more detailed response within **7 days** indicating our next steps.

We will keep you informed about our progress throughout the process of fixing the vulnerability.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Code Security
- **Automated Security Scanning**: We use CodeQL for static code analysis
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Dependabot automatically updates dependencies and monitors for vulnerabilities
- **Container Security**: Trivy scans Docker images for vulnerabilities with SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab
- **Python Security Linting**: Bandit identifies common security issues in Python code
- **Dependency Auditing**: Safety and pip-audit scan for known vulnerable packages
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog prevents accidental secret exposure

### Infrastructure Security
- **Secure Docker Images**: Alpine Linux base images for minimal attack surface
- **Server Binding Security**: Default localhost-only bindings (127.0.0.1) instead of 0.0.0.0
- **HTTP Timeout Protection**: Proper timeout handling prevents hanging connections
- **Webhook Security**: All webhooks are verified using shared secrets
- **Access Control**: Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies and base images are kept up-to-date

## üìã Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| Previous| :white_check_mark: |
| Older   | :x:                |
