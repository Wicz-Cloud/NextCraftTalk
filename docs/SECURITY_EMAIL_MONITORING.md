# Security Email Monitoring Guide

## 📧 Monitoring security@wicz.cloud → Gmail Forwarding

This guide helps you monitor the security email address to meet our SLOs:
- **48 hours**: Acknowledge security reports
- **7 days**: Provide detailed response

## 🔧 Gmail Setup for Security Monitoring

### 1. Verify Email Forwarding
```bash
# Check if security@wicz.cloud forwards to your Gmail
# This should already be configured in your domain settings
```

### 2. Create Security Email Filters & Labels

#### Create a "Security" Label
1. Go to Gmail → Settings → See all settings → Labels
2. Create new label: "🔒 Security Reports"
3. Create sub-labels:
   - "🔴 Critical - ACK NEEDED" (red)
   - "🟠 High - ACK NEEDED" (orange)
   - "🟡 Medium - ACK NEEDED" (yellow)
   - "🟢 Acknowledged" (green)
   - "✅ Resolved" (blue)

#### Set Up Email Filters

**Filter 1: Security Reports**
```
From: *@*
To: security@wicz.cloud
Subject: [SECURITY]*
```
→ Apply label "🔒 Security Reports"
→ Mark as important
→ Never send to spam
→ Skip inbox (archive)

**Filter 2: Critical Priority**
```
From: *@*
To: security@wicz.cloud
Subject: (*CRITICAL*|*URGENT*|*EMERGENCY*)
```
→ Apply label "🔴 Critical - ACK NEEDED"
→ Mark as important
→ Send notification

### 3. Notification Settings

#### Desktop & Mobile Notifications
1. Gmail Settings → See all settings → General
2. Desktop notifications: **Important mail**
3. Mobile notifications: **All mail** (for security emails)

#### Email Notifications for Security Reports
1. Create a filter that matches security emails
2. Choose "Send notification" action
3. Set up SMS forwarding for critical alerts

## 📊 Response Tracking System

### Daily Monitoring Routine
```bash
# Check security emails every morning
# Use Gmail's "🔒 Security Reports" label
```

### Response Template System

#### Acknowledgment Template (within 48h)
```
Subject: [ACK] Security Report Received - #{REPORT_ID}

## ⏰ SLO Monitoring & Alerts

### Automated Reminders

#### 24-Hour Reminder (prevents missing 48h SLO)
```
# Create a Google Calendar event or reminder
# Set for 24 hours after security email receipt
# Label: "Security ACK Due - 48h SLO"
```

#### 5-Day Reminder (prevents missing 7-day SLO)
```
# Set reminder for 5 days after acknowledgment
# Label: "Security Response Due - 7-day SLO"
```

### Response Time Tracking

#### Manual Tracking Spreadsheet
| Report ID | Received | Acknowledged | Response Sent | Severity | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| SEC-001   | 2025-10-25 | 2025-10-26 | 2025-10-30 | High | Fixed |

#### Automated Tracking (Advanced)
```bash
# Use Gmail API or Zapier to track response times
# Calculate average response times
# Alert if SLOs are at risk of being missed
```

## 🚨 Escalation Procedures

### Missing SLO Alerts
- **48h ACK not sent**: Immediate personal alert
- **7-day response not sent**: Escalate to team lead
- **Critical severity**: Immediate notification regardless of time

### Backup Monitoring
- Set up secondary email monitoring
- Configure team member access for redundancy
- Use shared inbox if multiple people need access

## 🛠️ Tools & Automation

### Recommended Tools

#### Gmail Add-ons
- **Boomerang**: Schedule delayed responses
- **Snooze**: Temporarily hide emails until SLO deadline
- **Mailtrack**: Track email opens (for acknowledgments)

#### Productivity Tools
- **Zapier/IFTTT**: Automate labeling and notifications
- **Google Sheets**: Track response metrics
- **Calendar Integration**: SLO deadline reminders

#### Advanced Monitoring
```bash
# Example: Use Gmail filters with Google Apps Script
# to automatically track and alert on SLO violations

function checkSecuritySLOS() {
  var threads = GmailApp.search('label:"🔴 Critical - ACK NEEDED" older_than:2d');
  if (threads.length > 0) {
    // Send alert for missed 48h SLO
    GmailApp.sendEmail('your-email@gmail.com',
                       '🚨 SECURITY SLO ALERT',
                       'Critical security reports need acknowledgment!');
  }
}
```
